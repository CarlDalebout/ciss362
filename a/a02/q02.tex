Assume you have a set that contains a white and a black hourse = {white, black}
based on their inducton set provided if you were to remove the black horse from the set then all horses in the set will be white
then if you put the black hourse back and remove the white horses all hourses in the set will be of all Black horses
but k+1 would not work because the white horse and the black horse are not the same color.
