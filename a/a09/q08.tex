(a) $T$ derives strings containing any number of $0$s (including none) and
exactly one $\#$.
Therefore $TT$ derives strings with any number of $0$s and exactly two
$\#$s.
$U$ derives strings of the form $0^n \# 0^{2n}$.
Hence $L(G)$ contains strings with any number of $0$s and exactly two
$\#$ or strings of the form $0^n \# 0^{2n}$, i.e.,
\[
L(G) = L(0^* \# 0^* \# 0^*) \cup \{0^n \# 0^{2n} \mid n \geq 0\} 
\]
